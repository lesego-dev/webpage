                        <p class="article-body">The “Power of Flowers” isn’t just a throwback to the tie-dye era of peace and love and nonviolence. Though I won’t discount the relevance that those values hold today and the need for them in our lives. What it reflects is that flowers can provide an important symbol of unity that helps gather a group of people and weave them together around a shared sense of purpose.</p>

                        <p class="article-body">Winters can be very long, especially in northern climates. For months, the white and gray-covered landscape offers a beauty all its own, and colorful it is not. Green growth is at a standstill while mother nature takes a much needed rest. The first flowering signs of spring to show in the landscape here can include yellow Forsythia, fragrant Daffodils, and tri-petaled Trillium. After almost six months of whiteness, anything yellow, pink, purple, peach, or green is a very welcomed sight. To watch a Daffodil bud crack through the thawing earth and make daily progress towards blossoming into a fragrant bloom can be thrilling. Planting a small handful of seeds into the soil and awaiting their emergence and growth fills us with anticipation and a sense of hope. </p>
